# Ridge_Lasso_regression
Regularization is implemented to avoid overfitting of the data, especially when there is a large variance between train and test set performances.
If a model uses the L1 regularization technique, then it is called lasso regression. Ridge regression puts a similar constraint on the coefficients by introducing a penalty factor. However, while lasso regression takes the magnitude of the coefficients, ridge regression takes the square.
